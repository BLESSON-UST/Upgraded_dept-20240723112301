The current version of the Java file provided is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the code structure and imports, it appears to be compatible with Java 8 or later versions. Here's the modified code upgraded to be compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.repository;

import com.UST.departmentservice.model.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
    Department findByDepartmentId(Long departmentId);
}
```

Note: In the modified code, the package and model names are assumed to be updated based on the Java Naming Conventions.
