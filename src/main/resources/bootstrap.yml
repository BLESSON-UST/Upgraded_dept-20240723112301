The provided content does not appear to be Java code. It seems to be a configuration file in YAML format. Java code files typically have a `.java` extension.

To upgrade the configuration file to be compatible with Java 17, we can convert the YAML format to Java code using the `org.yaml.snakeyaml` library. Here is the modified code in Java:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

import java.io.InputStream;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.Map;

public class UpgradeConfigFile {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the YAML file
        InputStream inputStream = Files.newInputStream(Paths.get("config.yaml"));
        Yaml yaml = new Yaml();
        Map<String, Object> data = yaml.load(inputStream);

        // Upgrade the configuration
        data.put("cloud", Map.of(
                "config", Map.of(
                        "enable", true,
                        "uri", "http://localhost:9296"
                )
        ));

        // Print the upgraded configuration
        System.out.println(yaml.dump(data));
    }
}
```

Please note that in order to run this code, you'll need to include the `snakeyaml` library in your project.
