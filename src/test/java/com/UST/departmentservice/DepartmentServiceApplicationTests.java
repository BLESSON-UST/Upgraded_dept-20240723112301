Below is the modified code, upgraded to be compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class DepartmentServiceApplicationTests {

	@Test
	void contextLoads() {
	}

}
```
There were no changes required in the code as it is already compatible with Java 17 and there were no new language features, standards, or best practices to be incorporated for the target version. The code remains the same.
